# Exploring-Trust-and-Strategies-in-Agent-Human-Teaming-using-the-Overcooked-game
This repository documents my Capstone work

This work delves into evaluating trust in agent-human teaming in the gaming domain. 
This capstone project combines a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) component as well as an analytic component. 
Here we provide a definition of “trust” relevant to the Overcooked game and perform a study where volunteers play this game and answer survey questions based on their experience. 
The game-play videos recorded during the study were used to train an Object Recognition model to test the robustness of the video. 
Self-Organizing Maps were used to cluster the trajectories obtained from the game to identify the factors that influence trust.
